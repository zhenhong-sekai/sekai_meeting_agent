Current Workflow State:
- User's instruction: {last_user_message}
- Meeting name: {meeting_name or "Not specified"}
- Transcript available: {"Yes" if (transcript_path or transcript) else "No"}
- Summary generated: {"Yes" if summary else "No"}
- Todo list generated: {"Yes" if todo else "No"}
- Feedback generated: {"Yes" if feedback else "No"}
- Notion page created: {"Yes" if notion_parent_id else "No"}


Step Summary History:
{chr(10).join([f"{i+1}. {step}" for i, step in enumerate(step_summary)])}

Available Routes and Next Steps:
- 'zoom': Handle Zoom recordings/transcripts. Use when user needs transcript URL or transcript processing.
  Next step examples: "Find transcript URL for the meeting", "Locate Zoom recording for meeting X"
- 'debrief': Generate summaries, todos, and feedback from transcripts. Use when transcript is available and user wants analysis.
  Next step examples: "Generate meeting summary and extract action items", "Create summary and feedback from transcript"
- 'notion': Publish results to Notion. Use when user explicitly requests saving/publishing to Notion.
  Next step examples: "Create Notion page with meeting results", "Publish summary and todos to Notion"
- 'end': Terminate workflow. Use when all requested tasks are complete or user wants to end.
  Next step examples: "Complete workflow - all tasks finished", "End workflow - user request fulfilled"

Routing Rules:
1. If user asks for transcript/recording and none is available â†’ 'zoom'
2. If transcript is available and user wants summary/todo/feedback â†’ 'debrief'
3. If user explicitly mentions Notion/saving/publishing â†’ 'notion'
4. If all requested tasks are complete â†’ 'end'
5. If user asks to end/stop â†’ 'end'
6. Default after debrief unless Notion is explicitly requested â†’ 'end'

Please analyze the current state and user request to determine the appropriate next step.

User Instruction: {last_user_message}

{context}

Based on the current state and user request, determine:
1. Which route to take (zoom/debrief/notion/end)
2. What the next step should be - clearly describe what the next agent will accomplish for the user, and also include relevant context for the next agent to know what to do. Make sure to include the user's instruction in the next step.
3. Your reasoning for this decision

Return a structured response with your routing decision and next step description.
